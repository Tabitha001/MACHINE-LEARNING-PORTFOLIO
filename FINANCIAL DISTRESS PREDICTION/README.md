Overview

The Financial Distress Prediction project is a data-driven initiative that aims to build a reliable and accurate predictive model for anticipating economic hardship in companies and institutions.
Financial distress can lead to severe consequences such as bankruptcy, insolvency, and adverse economic conditions, affecting stakeholders, investors, and employees.
By developing an early warning system, this project seeks to empower decision-makers with valuable insights, enabling them to take proactive measures and mitigate potential risks.


Motivation

The essential task of predicting financial distress is the main driving force behind this research.
Numerous organizations and corporations experience financial health difficulties, and prompt detection of warning signs can significantly influence the direction of strategic decisions.
It is believed that using past financial data, key performance indicators, and macroeconomic factors might offer insightful information on the financial health of businesses and institutions in the future.


Project Targets

Create a reliable financial distress prediction algorithm that can recognize organizations and businesses that face economic hardship.
Determine the important financial ratios and performance metrics that serve as early signs of financial distress.
Address class imbalance in the dataset to ensure the model's fairness and avoid bias towards the majority class
Provide an interpretable and explainable model to help stakeholders understand the factors influencing predictions.


Data and Methodology

The project makes use of a broad dataset that includes key macroeconomic variables and historical financial statements. 
The data is preprocessed using statistical methods in order to find important indications and machine learning algorithms are used to develop the predictive model. 
To verify the model's efficacy and dependability, its performance is extensively assessed using standard metrics.
